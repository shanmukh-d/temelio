# Temelio


Large foundations tend to distribute money to several hundreds of nonprofits within a year. For legal reasons, the foundation needs to formally email each nonprofit a message that contains the nonprofit's name, the address, and the current date.

As you can imagine, it is tedious for foundations to manually create an email for each nonprofit they distribute money to. We want to help make their process easier by building some UI and API endpoints to manage this workflow.
